# Network-Packet-Loss-Simulation
Some python programs that transfers packets through a network, with a custom packet loss rate. Produced for a group assignment at University.

The Sender, will send a text file to the channel, in the form of man packets. The Channel will drop packets depending on the user set packet loss rate. The thannel will then pass the packets through to the Reciever, which will save the packets to another text file. The Reciever will then send an acknowledgement packet to the Sender to confirm the packets receival.
